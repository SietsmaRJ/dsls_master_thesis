    "##### Hart- en vaatziekten\n",
    "Every p_greater has a high P-value, indicating the category is not performing better than any other panel. Interestingly, Amyloidose, Leukemie-Lymfoom, 5GPM, OWA, Noonan syndroom, Cardiomyopathie bij kinderen, mitochondriele aandoeningen, hyper/hypofosfatemie, primaire cilliare dyskinesie en angio-oedeem also accepts H0 for two-sided and less, so it performs simular to them.\n",
    "##### Erfelijke Kanker\n",
    "Now quite the opposite of Hart- en vaatziekten, where p_lower accepts H0 except for maybe Angio-oedeem, meaning that everything is performing either worse or on par. Only Hart- en vaatziekten, epilepsie, metabole & leverziekten, aangeboren hartafwijkingen have some statistical proof of being better / worse than erfelijke kanker.\n",
    "##### Primaire Immuundeficientie\n",
    "Primaire immuundefientie is pretty much the average panel, only Hart- en vaatziekten performs statistically performs worse. Everything else is null hypothesis.\n",
    "###### Angio-oedeem\n",
    "Should be performing the best, a lot of high less p values is seen. But the null hypothesis for two-sided and greater can't be rejected in a single instance, so it might be performing better at sight, but it performs just average (which is good, this means CAPICE has a high average in the UMCG genepanels).\n"
